## Declaration
The solution work is contributed by everyone within our group. The solutions for Question D are refered from other researchers. Especially, No.5 and No.6 questions are solved by the research of `Multi-Camera People Tracking with a Probabilistic Occupancy Map` and `基于视频的拥挤场景中异常事件检测方法研究-刘凤桐Fengtong Liu`.

The matlab codes for No.6 question are based on Fengtong Liu's paper and codes. However, the original codes didn't include the data of crowd videos and cannot be debuged correctly. Therefore, our group solved those problems and decided to publish only No.6 codes revised by us.

We deliver thanks to the researchers of two papers above.
